# Inclusify

**Inclusify** is a Python application designed to enhance the accessibility of the UBS workspace by integrating gesture recognition and voice commands into everyday tasks. With Inclusify, users can interact with their computer using intuitive hand gestures and voice commands, reducing physical strain and improving user experience.

## Why we made this app
A technology's usefulness is directly proportional to how widely available it is - how many people can understand and interact with it. In the UK 24% of the working-age population are reported to have a disability and many of the applications that we interact with on a day-to-day are not accessible for all and our aim is to change that. 


## Features

- **Gesture-Based Mouse Control**: Navigate and interact with your computer using hand gestures.
- **Scrolling Function**: Perform scrolling actions with simple hand movements.

- **Action Mapping**: Map gestures to predefined computer actions for a more efficient workflow.
